- Decide between C + GLIB against C++ + Boost
- Choose make tool to use (cmake?) and create the skeleton makefile for the project
- Create the main program
- Make main program run as a daemon
- Make main program read configuration files, preferably in [yaml, http://www.yaml.org/]
- Make main program listen to a port and attend requests
- Choose between Threads or Process + IPC. It's imperative that seg faults on business units don't crash the server
- Implement the multiple thread system and make it answer to requests
- Build a file od BD queue system
- Create an administration interface that communicates to the server and change the application files. Most likely the admin interface and any web part of the app server will be a ruby on rails app
